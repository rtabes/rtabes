## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a <b>product manager</b> looking to buff up my technical skills! I want to learn how to build some things myself. ğŸ› 

 ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how web development works, so you might see some very weird things around here
 ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m interested in how to become a technical product manager or product engineer.
